# PoolDash
This app helps you chemically balance your swimming pool.

### Why
Pool care is complicated, but there are answers. However, most people providing these answers are incentivized to sell expensive chemicals and equipment. Pooldash decouples the advice from the sales.

I've made 3 pool-care apps in the last decade, with over 50,000 users. However, I work full-time and can't support the apps by myself. I'm hopeful that allowing anyone to view the source-code will ease the burden on me & allow other community members to step up & contribute (shoutout to [@wc0sby](https://github.com/wc0sby) for taking the lead).

The app is written in React Native & will be available on iOS and Android. For now, if you're a developer, here is how you can build & run the app locally:

# To Begin:

## Install the dependencies:

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
- This is a package-manager for OS X (it automates the complex installation open-source 3rd-party libraries, such as node)

[node](https://nodejs.org/en/): `brew install node`
- This is the runtime environment for modern javascript-based applications

[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/): `npm install yarn`
- This manages 3rd-party open-source javascript libraries efficiently (sort-of like a more specific version of brew)

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): `npm install -g typescript`
- This is the programming language that PoolDash is written in! It is Javascript with static types & even more dependencies ðŸ˜….

[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/): `npm install -g react-native-cli`
- This is the application framework that PoolDash is built on. It allows the app to run on both iOS and Android devices!

## Build the project

1) `git clone git@github.com:Gazzini/PoolDash.git` (or download the .zip file)

2) `cd PoolDash`

3) `yarn install` -- Installs all of the dependencies listed in package.json

4) `tsc -w` -- Compiles all of the typescript code into javascript code (use "yarn run" to ensure you're using the local typescript version)

5) `react-native start` -- Prepares the react-native environment to serve javascript files to your iOS or Android app (do this in a separate terminal tab)

6) `react-native run-ios` -- Compiles & Runs the Xcode project, Launches the simulator, and loads your javascript bundle from your local React server


# Required Next Steps:
- [ ] Implement multiple service-plans, allow users to select a "recipe"
- [ ] Move the formulas from `src/InitialData.ts` somewhere it can easily be accessed / edited in isolation
- [ ] Implement [material styles](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper)
- [ ] Persistently store chemical records for later viewing
- [ ] Enable cloud-sync (using Realm, for now)
- [ ] Submit to iOS store
- [ ] Submit to Android store
- [ ] Open-source attributions

# Nice-to-haves:
- [ ] Graphs of pool chemicals over time
- [ ] Youtube video links for each step of every "recipe"
- [ ] Secret Project (ðŸ™Š)
