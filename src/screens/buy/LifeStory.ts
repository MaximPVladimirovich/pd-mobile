I used to maintain pools for a living. Now, Iâ€™m a software engineer at a big company, and this is my passion-project. I hope it makes your day a little better!

Your pool data is in good hands -- your own! I don't sync it from this app to my servers. I want to build pooldash sustainably based on paying users, not for free based on selling data. If pooldash does well enough to become my full-time job, I might add an online backup feature. In the mean-time, I ensure your privacy by not collecting your pool's data!`;
